    <p>Welcome to the Easy Piano Learning Privacy Policy. Your privacy is our priority, and this document outlines how we collect, manage, store, and protect the data you share while using our application. We value your trust and strive to ensure transparency in all aspects of data handling. This Privacy Policy applies to all interactions with the Easy Piano Learning application and is intended to give you clarity about how your information is used.

Our approach involves safeguarding all collected information using advanced encryption technologies and adhering to international privacy standards.</p>
    <p>The Easy Piano Learning app does not collect personally identifiable information. Instead, we gather anonymous usage data, including actions performed within the app, the duration of sessions, error logs, and trends in user behavior. This anonymized data helps us enhance the app's functionality, optimize performance, and identify areas for improvement. It is important to emphasize that this information cannot be traced back to any individual user.</p>
    <p>All data collected by the Easy Piano Learning application is processed and stored securely. We use encryption protocols to ensure that data remains protected from unauthorized access or breaches. The servers used for storage are located in secure facilities that meet industry standards for data protection. Retention periods are strictly managed, with collected data being retained for three months before automatic deletion. This practice aligns with our commitment to minimizing risks and upholding user trust.</p>
    <p>We do not share collected data with third-party entities. Our use of data is strictly limited to improving the app's functionality and ensuring a seamless user experience. In the rare instance where legal obligations require disclosure, we comply fully with applicable laws while safeguarding user interests. By maintaining control over all aspects of data processing, we ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the information entrusted to us.</p>
    <p>Your rights as a user are integral to our privacy practices. We are committed to providing transparency about our data collection and usage policies. While the anonymized nature of the data prevents specific deletion requests, we ensure that users are informed about our practices through this Privacy Policy. If you have concerns or questions about data handling, you are encouraged to contact us for further clarification. We are dedicated to maintaining an open dialogue and addressing user inquiries in a timely and thorough manner.</p>
    <p>The Easy Piano Learning app is designed to comply with all relevant data protection laws, including but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our commitment to compliance is reflected in the implementation of secure data collection and storage methods. We do not require user consent for anonymized data collection, as this process does not involve personally identifiable information. Users can rest assured that their data is handled responsibly and in compliance with the highest standards of privacy protection.</p>
    <p>The app is suitable for users of all age groups, including children. We take special care to ensure that our data collection practices are appropriate and compliant with regulations such as the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). By avoiding the collection of personal information, we provide a safe and secure environment for younger users while maintaining the same level of privacy protection for all users.</p>
    <p>We understand that the digital landscape is ever-evolving, and we are committed to staying up to date with the latest privacy practices and regulations. This Privacy Policy is subject to periodic review, and any changes will be reflected in this document. Users are encouraged to review this page regularly to stay informed about updates. By continuing to use the app, you acknowledge that you have read and agreed to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
